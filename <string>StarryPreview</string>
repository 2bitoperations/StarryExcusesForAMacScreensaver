(Do not include the `.icns` extension.)

## 6. Test in System Settings

1. Install or build the saver.
2. Open System Settings > Screen Saver.
3. If the old icon still appears:
   - Quit System Settings.
   - Optionally clear the icon cache (log out/in or reboot if stubborn).
   - Re-open System Settings.

You should now see your custom screenshot-derived icon.

## 7. Updating Later

Just regenerate a new screenshot and repeat steps 2–4. The plist does not need further modification unless you rename the icon.

## 8. Troubleshooting

- Icon not showing: ensure the .icns is inside the built bundle under `Contents/Resources/StarryPreview.icns`.
- Blurry small icon: consider hand-tuning the 16×16 and 32×32 PNGs with higher contrast or slightly enlarged moon/silhouette details before running `iconutil`.
- Changed but System Settings still shows old: macOS caches aggressively; try a different filename (e.g. StarryPreview2) and update Info.plist if urgent, then revert after cache clears.

Enjoy your authentic preview icon!
